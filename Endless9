# 1. Initial Data: A list of integers
original_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

print(f"Original list of numbers: {original_numbers}")

# 2. List Comprehension
# [ expression for item in iterable if condition ]

    # expression: square the number (number ** 2)
    number ** 2

# 3. Output the result
