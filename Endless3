# 1. Define a list of items (a sequence)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# 2. Loop through each item in the 'fruits' list
for fruit in fruits:
    # 'fruit' will hold each item from the list in turn
    print(f"I enjoy eating a {fruit}.")

# 3. Add a message after the loop finishes
print("\nThat's all the fruit in the list!")
